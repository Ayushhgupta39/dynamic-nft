#Dynamic NFT
This project is about connecting APIs to your Smart Contracts using Chainlink.

### What is a dynamic NFT?
A dynamic NFT is a non-fungible token that can be changed based on certain circumstances.

For example, there are currently eight different LaMelo Ball NFTs, with each NFT recording a different set of LaMelo’s player statistics, from rebounds and assists to points scored.

It gets even cooler,

One of these eight NFTs, the Gold Evolve NFT, came with a unique promise:

If LaMelo Ball won Rookie of the Year for the 2021 NBA season, the NFT itself would evolve to reflect a new image. LaMelo won the award and the NFT evolved.

### About this project
In the project, I'll build a Dynamic NFT using [Chainlink’s decentralized and cryptographically secured oracle network ](https://chain.link/) to get and track asset price data.

We'll learn to build a Dynamic NFT that changes based on market data using Chainlink Oracles that pull data from external sources into a smart contract.

- #### What are Oracles?
    For smart contracts, oracles are a middle-ware product in which data outside of the blockchain (such as real-world data from weather to stocks) is connected to it. That data is then used for conditions of smart contracts. Ethereum is self-contained, so oracles would allow smart contracts to branch out into real-world applications by bringing the data to it. An example of this would be sports betting, where a smart contract would be resolved by receiving the scores of a sporting event.
